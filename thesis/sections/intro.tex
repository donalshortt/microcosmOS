The goal of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of kernels and the work that goes in to their development while also providing a potentially useful resource for those who wish to study cpu attacks that make use of side channels. This is achieved by creating an environment that is only as complicated as it needs to be in order to minimise the noise[footnote?] generated by the kernel.  is useful as it allows one to more easily measure the data that they are interested in.
