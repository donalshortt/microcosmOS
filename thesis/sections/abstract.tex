This paper describes a project that aims to create a low-noise kernel in order to demonstrate cpu attacks that make use of a side channel. Attacks which make use of a side channel can be complicated by channel interference and so this project aims to minimise those complications.
We will first give a high level overview of the system followed by a more detailed look at the design of the kernel and discuss various advantages and disadvantages each design decision entails afterwhich we will briefly go over the implementation of the kernel. From there we will move on to two example attacks that can be performed, flush + reload and spectre. Finally we will evaluate the kernel, discuss related.... THIS SHOULD BE WRITTEN LAST
